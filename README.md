# 👋 Hi All
I am building my path in cybersecurity and computer science through hands-on projects and continuous learning. 
Most of the work here reflects my personal learning process — experimenting, testing ideas, breaking things, fixing them, and understanding how systems behave under real-world conditions. 
I focus on security logic, threat analysis, and creating practical tools that improve resilience and defensive thinking.
